[16:15] [35;1mYou tell Byron:[0m store clerk tried to fight me for putting my groceries down... which I only did because he walked away from the only register and wandered around store... I tried to tell him I
[16:15]         put them down because he walked away, he didn't understand, throwing receipt at me, etc... I tried to have words, he gets in my face trying to push me out of store... I called police to
[16:15]         supervise so I could go back in and report to management... policeman called me a pussy, I called him a piece of shit, wrote me a ticket for 40 euros... and was about to arrest me
[16:16] [35;1mYou tell Byron:[0m filed formal complaint with police station, shrug
[16:16] [35;1mYou tell Byron:[0m also getting screwed by freelance client... not responding to me for the $5k project I just did and didn't get paid for, heh... good times... but interiewing for new work, might

[16:47] [35;1mYou tell Byron:[0m yeah the clerk thing was weird and unexpected, just some twirp having a bad day... nothing better to do but leave register, walk around empty store and complain about me putting
